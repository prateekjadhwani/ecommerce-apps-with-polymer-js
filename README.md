# Building eCommerce Web Applications with Polymer.js

Written by [Prateek Jadhwani](https://github.com/prateekjadhwani) and Published on [Gitbooks](https://prateekjadhwani.gitbooks.io/ecommerce-apps-with-polymer-js/content/)

A gitbook that tells users how to build eCommerce apps using PolymerJS. 

###Summary

I personally think of eCommerce apps as the apps with highest complexity with tonnes of business rules that should work in sync with each other without affecting the performance. This book gives you a brief idea on how Polymer elements should work, how someone with basic HTML, JavaScript and CSS knowledge can start building their elements and make them work like a web app. This book also covers how these polymer elements can be created to work in eCommerce projects with high performance.
