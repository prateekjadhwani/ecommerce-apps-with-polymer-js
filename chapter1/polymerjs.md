# What is Polymer

Polymer.js is a front-end library built on top of the concept of Web Components. Its main purpose is to create web components in easiest way possible. It does all the things that a Web Component does; 
* Creating a custom element
* Encapsulating itself in its own Shady DOM
* Manages dependencies with the help of HTML imports
* And uses templates for rendering divs

### So wait, what's the difference between Web Components and Polymer?

Just like we have [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), a JS library that provides short hands for DOM manipulation, event binding and all sorts of JavaScript related work, Polymer is also a library, but for Web Components.
